I am writing to apply for the \JobPositionName{}.

I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Oklahoma in May 2018 and currently look for a postdoctoral research position in the field of high energy physics experiment.
In the past three years, I was relocated at CERN working on my dissertation research.
I am familiar with C++ and Python programming, experimental data analysis using ROOT, and the ATLAS environment.
I am confident that my background makes me fit this challenging position and I would be a valuable addition to your team.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
