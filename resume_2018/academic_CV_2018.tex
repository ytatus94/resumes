Mainly contributed on electron isolation measurement, real lepton efficiency measurement, and Non-Universal Higgsino Mass model with 2 extra parameters (NUHM2) search.
\item Calibrated the electron isolation efficiency by analyzing $Z \to ee$ events using Tag-and-Probe method. The results became ATLAS recommendations. %The results became a central released version (recommendation) of the ATLAS collaboration.
\item Used C++ and Python to implement Monte Carlo, event selection and reconstruction, background suppression, maximum likelihood, and least Chi square fit to analyze collision data within 95\% confidence level.
% The various analysis methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, candidates extraction, noise suppression, maximum likelihood estimation are implemented.
% Finally, the least Chi-square fit and statistical interpretations are applied on the data to extract signals.
% The various analysis methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, event selection and reconstruction, background suppression are mainly implemented by C/C++ and the results are visualized using Python with the PyRoot package.
% The various analysis methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, event selection and reconstruction (data mining \& EDA), background suppression (feature processing \& feature engineering) are mainly implemented by C/C++ and the results are visualized using Python with the PyRoot package.
\item Developed a new object-oriented programming framework in C++ increasing the performance and accuracy of the real lepton efficiency measurement.
The new framework processes datasets 10 times larger than the previous one, automates analysis procedures reducing a week manual operations to 5 hours, and increases the efficiency to 98\%.
\item Co-developed and maintained the C++ based Tag-and-probe framework for E/gamma combine performance group.
% \item Analyzed large proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector complex using C++ and Python and automated the visualization of results.
