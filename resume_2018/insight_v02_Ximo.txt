Reworked:
I worked on measuring the search for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles in strong and electroweak interactions in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, as well as in the measurement of electron efficiencies.
Since electrons are very prominently produced in the LHC collisions, almost all physics analyses in ATLAS require well-isolated electrons to effectively separate signal and background.
[REMOVE, too technical] Simulated Monte Carlo events are generated and electrons to be studied are selected using samples of events for which a Z boson decays to electron and positron pair by the Tag-and-probe method.
Different isolation criteria are defined depending on , the isolation efficiencies are calculated and compared with the one obtained using real data, then the isolation scale factors are computed.
[REWORKED] The efficiency for different isolation requirements, that is, criteria on the activity measured in the detectors around the electrons, is measured using Z boson decays to electron and positron pair, and scale factors are derived to correct simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events for possible differences with the data.
In the search for SUSY particles, one of the theoretically most well motivated models for new physics, the kinematic distributions of the signal and background MC samples are studied.
[REMOVE, not very relevant] Three regions: signal regions (SR), control regions (CR), and validation regions (VR) are defined for studying the background contributions.
[REWORKED] After the application of requirements to enhance the contribution for SUSY signal (in the so-called Signal Regions, SR), the background contributions are estimated by extrapolating the number of events observed in other regions enhanced in background (Control Regions, CR) to the SR by means of a simultaneous fit.
 [REMOVE, we want to discover!!]and the results are shown at the 95% confidence level .
[IT’S ABOUT YOU! What did you do for this CR->SR fits?] I took care of XXX using the [framework HistFitter, widely used in ATLAS and other experiments for statistical treatment of the data]


Original:
I worked on measuring the electron isolation efficiency and searching for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles in strong and electroweak interactions.
Because electrons are common physics objects in the particle physics experiment, all analyses require well-isolated electrons to reduce the background effectively.
The Monte Carlo events are generated and electrons to be studied are selected using samples of events for which a Z boson decays to electron and positron pair by the Tag-and-probe method.
Different isolation criteria are applied based on the likelihood, the isolation efficiencies are calculated and compared with the one obtained using real data, then the isolation scale factors are computed.
When searching for SUSY particles, the kinematic distributions of the signal and background MC samples are studied.
Three regions: signal regions (SR), control regions (CR), and validation regions (VR) are defined for studying the background contributions.
The background contributions in the SR are predicted by extrapolating the fitted background in the CR and validated using the VR.
The signal in the data are extracted using a simutaneous fit and the results are shown at the 95% confidence level.

Q2:
What programming / scripting / statistical languages, data analysis software and/or databases have you worked with and in what capacity? Please make a detailed list. For each language, database or software, list how much time you spent working with it and briefly describe the work you did and what results you obtained to give us a sense of your proficiency. *

I know C/C++, Python, BASH shell script, Fortran 77/95, VBA, SQL, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, Scipy
I started to program in C/C++, BASH, and Fortran from 2003, and Python from 2015.
I used VBA to develop some handy routines for my daily work from 2006 to 2009 when I was a SPICE engineer working in TSMC.
I learnt basic SQL operations by taking all the SQL courses from Codecademy and I am learning how to use the popular data analysis packages such as Matpoltlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy now.

As a student in elementary particle physics, I started to program in C++ and used the BASH shell script to do automation since my master degree in 2003.
At that time, there were some popular packages, for example, PAW, wrote in Fortran 77 so I learnt Fortran 77 and 95 too and knew how to interface Fortran to C++.
Because the C++ based ROOT framework developed by CERN became a standard for particle physics analysis and Python is getting more attention in the elementary particle physics, I started to use Python from 2015.
And I became a full time Python user about the end of 2016 and only used C++ when it is strictly necessary.
In my research, the datasets are processed, the events are skimmed and slimmed, the distributions are computed, and the results are dumped into N-tuples or histograms using C++.
The results are manipulated, analysed, fitted, tabularized and visualized using Python.
Automations are done by BASH or Python depending on the situation.

Most of the companies rely on using Microsoft Excel in their business [IS THAT TRUE?? REALLY?].
Unfortunately, most of the employees don't know how to program using VBA.
I learnt and developed some VBA programs in Excel to avoid the mistakes by manual operations and repeat the daily routines.
