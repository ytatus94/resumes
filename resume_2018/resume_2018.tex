\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Organisation Europ\'{e}enne pour la Recherche Nucl\'{e}aire (CERN)}
\descript{| Physicist}
\location{2015 - 2018 | Geneva, Switzerland}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Analysed proton-proton collision data collected by ATLAS detector.
\item Used Python with PyROOT to perform data analysis and automate the visualization of results.
\item Developed a new object-oriented programming framework using C++ to increase the performance and accuracy of the real election efficiency measurement. The new framework can process datasets 10 times larger than the previous one, automate analysis procedures reducing a week manual operations to an afternoon, and increase the efficiency upto 98\%.
%\item Co-developed and maintained the C++ based Tag-and-probe framework.
