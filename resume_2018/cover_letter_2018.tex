\justifying
%I am interesting in the position of JOBPOSITION (job id: JOBID) with COMPANY.
I am applying for the position of [JOB POSITION NAME] in [COMPANY]. I started to analyze data since I enrolled in my Ph.D program in high energy physics and prepared myself to work with data by learning necessary knowledge and skills.


%(USE A SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE THE REASON WHY APPLYING FOR THIS POSITION AT HERE.)

%For the last three years I have worked in analyzing the data at CERN where I was responsible for the analysis of two physics processes using the data collected by the experiment and also for developing a new software framework to enhance the performance.
%I am familiar with the C/C++ and Python languages because my doctorial research heavily relies on programming to analyze data.
%For the last three years I have worked in analyzing the data at CERN for my dissertation using C/C++ and Python.
%My physics Ph.D. background trained me to become a careful researcher and strengthened my problem solving skills allowing me to find the best way to reach correct answers.
The Ph.D. in high energy physics trained me to be a careful researcher and strengthened my problem solving skills.
I have worked in analyzing the data collected by the ATLAS experiment at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) for the past several years.
In order to analyze the huge amount of data producted by the experiment, I build analysis framework using C/C++ and Python.
The various analysis methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, even selection and reconstruction, background suppression are mainly implemented by C/C++ and the results are virtualized using Python with PyRoot package.
Finally, the signal are fitted and statistical interpretations are applied on the fitted results.
Because CERN is a huge international orginazation, I learned how to collaborate with colleagues coming from different countries with different cultures while I relocated at CERN.
 

Considering the differences between academia and industry, I took several data analysis and machine learning online courses from DataCamp, Codecademy and Coursera to familiar with the the knowledge and tools commonly used in the industry.
I believe these courses can help me to switch from the academia to the industry smoothly.
The skills such as querying data using SQL, manipulating and cleaning data using Pandas, virtualizing results using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and the machine learning using scikit-learn and Keras are in my toolbox now.
After finishing capstone projects and receiving certificates from online courses, I participated in the competitions on Kaggle to sharp my data analysis skills and learn from other experts.


I would welcome the chance to speak with you about the responsibilities of the [JOB POSITION NAME] position if you think I am a qualified candidate.
My resume containing detailed work experience and education is attached.
I think my background makes me an unique candidate to fit this challenging position and I would be a valuable addition to your team.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you for your consideration.

% Dear Ms. Hobbs,

% I am interested in the Data Scientist position with Google and I am confident that I would be a valuable addition to your team.

% For the last five years I have worked in a similar position at Facebook where I was responsible for the analysis of raw data and also for contributing to the creation of data products such as Facebook’s Graph Search. My time at Facebook taught me how to identify and answer industry-relevant questions and then how to use that information to create a cutting edge advantage for my team in the marketplace.

% The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science that I earned from DeVry University was instrumental to my success during my time as a data scientist at Facebook. Along the way to earning my degree I also developed a strong background in mathematics that has served me well in my pursuit to advance the interests of my employers. My experience at Facebook and my educational background make me a good fit for this position as does my personal passion for logical problem solving.

% Your time and consideration are appreciated and I look forward to hearing from you. You can reach me at (555) 497-4782. Thanks for your attention.

% Best,
