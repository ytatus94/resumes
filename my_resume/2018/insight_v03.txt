I worked on measuring the search for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles in strong and electroweak interactions in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, as well as in the measurement of electron efficiencies. Since electrons are very prominently produced in the LHC collisions, almost all physics analyses in ATLAS require well-isolated electrons to effectively separate signal and background. The efficiency for different isolation requirements, that is, criteria on the activity measured in the detectors around the electrons, is measured using Z boson decays to electron and positron pair, and scale factors are derived to correct simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events for possible differences with the data. In the search for SUSY particles, one of the theoretically most well motivated models for new physics, the kinematic distributions of the signal and background MC samples are studied. After the application of requirements to enhance the contribution for SUSY signal (in the so-called Signal Regions, SR), the background contributions are estimated by extrapolating the number of events observed in other regions enhanced in background (Control Regions, CR) to the SR by means of a simultaneous fit. I took care of the extraction of cross-sections of the model under studied using the HistFitter framework which is widely used in ATLAS and other experiments for statistical treatment of the data. The extracted cross-sections from the measured data were compared with the theoretical calculations and the statistical confidence level were set.

Q2:
What programming / scripting / statistical languages, data analysis software and/or databases have you worked with and in what capacity? Please make a detailed list. For each language, database or software, list how much time you spent working with it and briefly describe the work you did and what results you obtained to give us a sense of your proficiency. * 
#########################
I know C/C++, Python, BASH shell script, Fortran 77/95, VBA, SQL, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, Scipy.

1.) I started to program in C/C++, BASH, and Fortran from 2003, and Python from 2015.
As a student in elementary particle physics, I started to program in C++ and used the BASH shell script to do automation since my master degree in 2003. At that time, there were some popular packages, for example, PAW, wrote in Fortran 77 so I learnt Fortran 77 and 95 too and knew how to interface Fortran to C++. Because the C++ based ROOT framework developed by CERN became a standard for particle physics analysis and Python is getting more attention in the elementary particle physics, I started to use Python from 2015. And I became a full time Python user about the end of 2016 and only used C++ when it is strictly necessary. In my research, the datasets are processed, the events are skimmed and slimmed, the distributions are computed, and the results are dumped into N-tuples or histograms using C++. The results are manipulated, analysed, fitted, tabularized and visualized using Python. Automations are done by BASH or Python depending on the situation.

2.) I programed in Excel using VBA from 2006 to 2009.
When I was a SPICE engineer working in TSMC, my works relied on Excel heavily. So I learnt how to program in Excel using VBA. I developed several useful VBA programs in Excel to avoid making mistakes by manual operations, repeat the daily routines, and increase working efficiency. The functions in my VBA programs include converting file formats, calculating the SPICE parameters, generating tables and figures, producing the final reports. I also shared my VBA programs to my colleagues or helped them to develop some functions they need. 

3.) I learnt basic SQL operations by taking all the SQL courses from Codecademy and I am learning how to use the popular data analysis packages such as Matpoltlib, Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy now.

Q4:
If you have done any coursework relevant to data science please let us know which courses and any projects etc. done during the course. [Optional] 
Please include a short description of the courses and any in-course related projects that you may have completed.
#########################
I have taken Scientific Computing I (CS 4743/5743) in Fall 2013.
This course provides a solid foundation in the mathematical formulation and methods for solving static inverse problems (also called retrieval, regression or 3-D VAR problem).
This course covers finite dimensional vector spaces, matrices, multivariate calculus, formulation of least squares problems, matrix methods, and optimization algorithms.
Since all the assignments are MATLAB based, I learnt some basic MATLAB operations too.

Q5:
What excites you about becoming a data scientist and working in the tech industry * 
Please limit your response to one paragraph (4-8 sentences).
#########################
Physicists use the observations of experiments to derive the laws dominated the Universe and build complete mathematical models.  
Data scientists use large amounts of data to analyse the rules behind the seemingly disorderly things and predict the trends or behavior.
I am fascinated by predicting the market trends using the data with high statistics.
By knowing the consumers' behavior pattern, we could find the potential markets, predict the trends, and make a profit from it.
