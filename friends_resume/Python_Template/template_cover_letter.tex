Prior to my graduation, I joined a start-up company in the risk management sector and started to work on a credit value at risk calculation for corporate bonds. In my current role, I often take the initiatives to identify relevant quantitative methods to address issues raised during our weekly meetings. This experience has reassured me that a career in quantitative finance provides opportunities to make real impact with my skills.

My PhD training in physics granted me a variety of expertise in applied mathematics and statistics. While the main theory of my dissertation was developed in a pencil-and-paper approach, my problem-solving skills had been strengthened by the constant need of numerical computation in my graduate research; I acquired familiarity with a comprehensive numerical library for C/C++ language and became proficient in implementing ad hoc numerical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations. My last dissertation project involved hypothesis testing of the latest supernova models and it offered a great opportunity to set my foot in statistical analysis. In addition, I have completed the \textit{Machine Learning} course from Coursera from which I learned about data analytics methodologies as well as cross-validation of empirical models. These quantitative and technical skills will allow me to comprehend and implement models to fulfill the
[BRIEF POSITION TITLE's]
responsibilities.  

As a critical thinker and a careful researcher, there were numerous times in the past years that I pointed out my research adviser and colleague's mistakes and convince them with clarifying explanations. The teaching award and several research awards/grants that I received have also proven my excellent abilities in verbal and written presentations. I also possess great leadership and task management skills as I had an 11-month military experience in Taiwan with the last 6 months appointed in a leadership role. 

I am very excited about the

position and the prospect of leveraging my experience and skills
[at BRIEF COMPANY NAME or in this role].
It would be my pleasure to speak with you regarding my background and the responsibilities of this role. Please do not hesitate to contact me for an interview if you think my skills and qualifications align with your needs. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
